Geocoding Workflow:
  /parse:
    ✔ Parse address @done(20-04-30 10:04)
  /expand:
    ✔ Expand address @done(20-04-30 10:04)
  /suggest:
    ✔ Expanded address begins with @done(20-04-30 13:34)
    ✔ Unexpanded address begins with @done(20-04-30 13:34)
  /forward:
    ✔ Find matches based on intersection query @done(20-05-06 10:25)
    ✔ Find exact matches based on supplied components @done(20-05-06 12:57)
    ✔ Find matches loosely based on supplied components with ?broaden=true @done(20-05-06 12:57)
    ✔ Return all components for address with ?fields=* @done(20-05-06 14:05)
    ☐ Return score based on exact house_number, exact zipcode, and Jaro-Winkler distance of street
    ☐ Call geocod.io for any addresses we don't have to augment our database (does this belong in geocoder or in tax code?)
  /batch:
    ☐ Find matches for a list of address; ideally by looping over /forward calls
  /reverse:
    ✔ Return address within configured radius of supplied lat,lon point @done(20-05-06 14:33)
    ✔ Return address witing supplied radius of supplied lat,lon point with ?radius=<number in km> @done(20-05-06 14:33)
    ☐ Return score based on distance

API:
✔ Can we merge in the cascade branch? It definitely needs some cleanup. @done(20-05-06 14:05)
☐ Can we bring in geocod.io? It'd be nice to augment our address database.

Parsing:
✔ Parsing/Expansion as it's own API? (libpostal) @done(20-04-30 08:57)
☐ Using postal-async?
☐ Improving performance of usaddress parser? Is its accuracy necessary?
