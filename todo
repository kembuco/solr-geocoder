Geocoding Workflow:
  /parse:
    ☐ Parse address
  /expand:
    ☐ Expand address
  /suggest:
    ☐ Expanded address begins with
    ☐ Unexpanded address begins with
  /forward:
    ☐ Find matches based on intersection query
    ☐ Find exact matches based on supplied components
    ☐ Find matches loosely based on supplied components with ?exact=false
    ☐ Call geocod.io for any addresses we don't have to augment our database (does this belong in geocoder or in tax code?)
    ☐ Return all components for address with ?fields=*
    ☐ Return score based on exact house_number, exact zipcode, and Jaro-Winkler distance of street
  /batch:
    ☐ Find matches for a list of address; ideally by looping over /forward calls
  /reverse:
    ☐ Return address within configured radius of supplied lat,lon point
    ☐ Return address witing supplied radius of supplied lat,lon point with ?radius=<number in km>
    ☐ Return score based on difference

API:
☐ Can we merge in the cascade branch? It definitely needs some cleanup.
☐ Can we bring in geocod.io? It'd be nice to augment our address database.

Parsing:
✔ Parsing/Expansion as it's own API? (libpostal) @done(20-04-30 08:57)
☐ Using postal-async?
☐ Improving performance of usaddress parser? Is its accuracy necessary?
